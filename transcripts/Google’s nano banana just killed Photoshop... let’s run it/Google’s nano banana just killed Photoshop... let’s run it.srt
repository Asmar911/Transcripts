1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
A few days ago, image editing changed forever.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,420
Google released Gemini Flash 2.5 image,

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,160
coincidentally, with the same nickname

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,440
my ex-girlfriend gave me Nano Banana.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,760
That has everyone buy inputs on Adobe,

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,800
because Photoshop is officially dead.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,040
Instead of learning how to use all these antique tools,

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,600
you can now just prompt Nano Banana for changes,

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,760
and it's able to deliver any photo alterations you can imagine.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,400
And most importantly, while maintaining the consistency

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,520
of the original image.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,560
If you're an animator or graphic designer,

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,760
this can unlock massive productivity gains.

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,000
Like if you wanted to steal some meat canyon art

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,280
and make it do something else,

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,400
you can now accomplish that with a single prompt.

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,640
No talent, necessary.

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,240
Google is finally back to its roots building cool stuff,

19
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,040
and Flash 2.5 is a tool that makes stable diffusion

20
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,480
look like Microsoft's paint.

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,240
In today's video, we'll take a look at all of its capabilities

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,000
and find out if our Adobe puts will actually print.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,600
It is August 29th, 2025, and you are watching the code report.

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Not only is Nano Banana an exceptional image model

25
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,720
that's already at the top of the L.M. Arena leaderboard,

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,080
but it's also extremely fast and affordable,

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,480
costing only 3.9 cents per image via the API.

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,720
And hypothetically, Google is also trained

29
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,800
in even more powerful Grondavenan app,

30
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,440
but it's unlikely the common man will ever get access to it.

31
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,520
The upgrade that most people are talking about, though,

32
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,160
is character consistency.

33
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,160
If you start with an image of a person or pet, for example,

34
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,200
the model can blend it with a different image

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,600
or make minor changes to it

36
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,040
without noticeably altering the original character.

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,760
Or multiple characters and objects,

38
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,680
like this guy did by blending 13 different images together.

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,760
That means if you want to link to

40
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,720
and headshot of yourself wearing a nice suit,

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,680
but can't afford to buy an actual suit,

42
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,160
Nano Banana has you covered.

43
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,280
In addition, if you work for the shadow government,

44
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,560
it can be used to implement Mandela effects,

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,320
like removing the cornacopia from the fruit of the loom logo.

46
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,640
That's cool, but if you're wanna be game developer,

47
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,040
one of the main showstoppers is the insane amount of time

48
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,680
it takes to build up a collection of good-looking assets

49
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,440
for all your characters and animations.

50
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Well, now, if you start with a base character,

51
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,080
you can prompt all the different positions

52
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,680
required for an animation.

53
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,880
Or better yet, just have Gemini generate

54
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,520
an entire sprite for you with all of them in a single prompt.

55
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,360
They keep in mind though, if you go this route,

56
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,720
you'll have to disclose any AI assets used

57
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,000
when you publish on Steam.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,280
And you can't lie about it because anything generated

59
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,280
with Google has an invisible watermark called SynthID.

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,880
What's kind of crazy about this model though

61
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,600
is that it also has an understanding of the real world.

62
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,520
Like if you point to a spot on Google Maps

63
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
and ask what a person would see there,

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
it can generate a realistic photo.

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,760
Or if you're a visual learner, you can sketch with it

66
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,600
step by step.

67
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,520
Like you could use the sketch tool to map out

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,000
your AWS infrastructure.

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,040
It's also pretty decent handling text,

70
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,560
so you can easily turn your images

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,600
into lame Instagram ads or memes.

72
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,760
But it's still not perfect,

73
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,400
so now let's talk about the bad stuff.

74
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,840
As you can see in my ad here,

75
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,160
it has a tendency to add extra characters to certain words.

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,680
In addition, I found that it often didn't follow my prompt

77
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,800
exactly and just kind of did its own thing.

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,680
Or in many cases, it just ignored the prompt

79
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,600
and did nothing at all.

80
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
And I think even the character consistency is a bit overhyped.

81
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,200
I tried it on a bunch of different images of real humans,

82
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,440
and it still has that obvious AI uncanny valley look to it.

83
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,680
And finally, as expected, as a Google product,

84
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,880
it's highly censored trying to generate anything

85
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,440
that's not safe for work is not going to happen.

86
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,840
But the best way to get the most out of these AI tools

87
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,640
is to learn how they work under the hood.

88
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,520
And you can do that for free with brilliant

89
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,160
the sponsor of today's video.

90
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,760
They're how AI workscores

91
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,960
teaches you how to build a functioning language model

92
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,280
from scratch, and lets you experiment with things

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,520
like feature vectors to edit facial expressions and images.

94
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,000
This hands-on approach to learning

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,600
helps you master challenging concepts over time.

96
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,840
And is proven to be six times more effective

97
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,560
than watching video lectures.
