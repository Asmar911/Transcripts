A few days ago, image editing changed forever. Google released Gemini Flash 2.5 image,

00:05.540 --> 00:08.460
coincidentally with the same nickname my ex-girlfriend gave me,

00:08.640 --> 00:13.740
Nano Banana. That has everyone buying puts on Adobe, because Photoshop is officially dead.

00:13.860 --> 00:18.020
Instead of learning how to use all these antique tools, you can now just prompt Nano Banana for

00:18.020 --> 00:22.660
changes and it's able to deliver any photo alterations you can imagine. And most importantly,

00:22.920 --> 00:27.420
while maintaining the consistency of the original image. If you're an animator or graphic designer,

00:27.420 --> 00:32.120
this can unlock massive productivity gains. Like if you wanted to steal some meat canyon art and

00:32.120 --> 00:36.400
make it do something else, you can now accomplish that with a single prompt. No talent necessary.

00:36.680 --> 00:41.240
Google is finally back to its roots building cool stuff, and Flash 2.5 is a tool that makes

00:41.240 --> 00:45.400
stable diffusion look like Microsoft Paint. In today's video, we'll take a look at all of its

00:45.400 --> 00:50.700
capabilities and find out if our Adobe puts will actually print. It is August 29th, 2025,

00:51.160 --> 00:55.420
and you're watching The Code Report. Not only is Nano Banana an exceptional image model that's

00:55.420 --> 00:57.400
already at the top of the LM Arena leaderboard, but it's also a great way to get your image

00:57.400 --> 01:03.220
but it's also extremely fast and affordable, costing only 3.9 cents per image via the API.

01:03.480 --> 01:08.420
And hypothetically, Google has also trained an even more powerful Grande Banana, but it's unlikely

01:08.420 --> 01:12.420
the common man will ever get access to it. The upgrade that most people are talking about though

01:12.420 --> 01:17.500
is character consistency. If you start with an image of a person or pet for example, the model

01:17.500 --> 01:22.020
can blend it with a different image or make minor changes to it without noticeably altering the

01:22.020 --> 01:26.720
original character. Or multiple characters and objects like this guy did by blending 13 different

01:26.720 --> 01:27.380
images together. If you're an animator or graphic designer, you can also use Nano Banana to

01:27.400 --> 01:29.620
create a character that looks like a human. That means if you want a LinkedIn headshot of yourself

01:29.620 --> 01:34.060
wearing a nice suit, but can't afford to buy an actual suit, Nano Banana has you covered.

01:34.060 --> 01:38.460
In addition, if you work for the Shadow government, it can be used to implement Mandela effects,

01:38.460 --> 01:42.660
like removing the cornucopia from the Fruit of the Loom logo. That's cool, but if you're a wannabe

01:42.660 --> 01:46.780
game developer, one of the main showstoppers is the insane amount of time it takes to build up a

01:46.780 --> 01:51.220
collection of good looking assets for all your characters and animations. Well now, if you start

01:51.220 --> 01:55.540
with a base character, you can prompt all the different positions required for an animation.

01:55.540 --> 01:56.500
Or better yet, just have Gemini, the main character, and the main character in the game. You can

01:56.500 --> 01:57.020
create a character that looks like a human, or a character that looks like a human, or a character that

01:57.020 --> 01:57.740
looks like a human, or a character that looks like a human. And you can also have Gemini generate

01:57.740 --> 02:01.900
an entire sprite for you with all of them in a single prompt. Keep in mind though, if you go this

02:01.900 --> 02:06.860
route, you'll have to disclose any AI assets used when you publish on Steam. And you can't lie about

02:06.860 --> 02:11.500
it, because anything generated with Google has an invisible watermark called SynthID. What's kind of

02:11.500 --> 02:15.980
crazy about this model though, is that it also has an understanding of the real world. Like if you

02:15.980 --> 02:20.300
point to a spot on Google Maps and ask what a person would see there, it can generate a realistic

02:20.300 --> 02:24.060
photo. Or if you're a visual learner, you can sketch with it step by step. Like you could use

02:24.060 --> 02:26.840
the Sketch tool to map out your AWS infrastructure. And it's a great way to get the most out of your

02:26.840 --> 02:31.400
It's also pretty decent at handling text, so you can easily turn your images into lame Instagram

02:31.400 --> 02:36.000
ads or memes. But it's still not perfect, so now let's talk about the bad stuff. As you can see in

02:36.000 --> 02:41.060
my ad here, it has a tendency to add extra characters to certain words. In addition, I found

02:41.060 --> 02:45.520
that it often didn't follow my prompt exactly and just kind of did its own thing. Or in many cases,

02:45.600 --> 02:49.760
it just ignored the prompt and did nothing at all. And I think even the character consistency is a

02:49.760 --> 02:54.020
bit overhyped. I tried it on a bunch of different images of real humans, and it still has that

02:54.020 --> 02:56.820
obvious AI uncanny valley look to it. And finally, I found that it's a little bit more

02:56.820 --> 03:01.040
as expected as a Google product, it's highly censored. Trying to generate anything that's

03:01.040 --> 03:05.920
not safe for work is not going to happen. But the best way to get the most out of these AI tools is

03:05.920 --> 03:10.220
to learn how they work under the hood. And you can do that for free with Brilliant, the sponsor of

03:10.220 --> 03:15.060
today's video. Their How AI Works course teaches you how to build a functioning language model from

03:15.060 --> 03:19.840
scratch, and lets you experiment with things like feature vectors to edit facial expressions and

03:19.840 --> 03:24.880
images. This hands-on approach to learning helps you master challenging concepts over time, and is

03:24.880 --> 03:26.800
proven to be six times more effective than the other. So if you're a visual learner, you should

03:26.820 --> 03:32.500
definitely try Brilliant. Try everything Brilliant has to offer for free by visiting brilliant.org
