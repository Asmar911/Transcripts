00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
A few days ago, image editing changed forever.

00:02.720 --> 00:05.420
Google released Gemini Flash 2.5 image,

00:05.420 --> 00:07.160
coincidentally, with the same nickname

00:07.160 --> 00:09.440
my ex-girlfriend gave me Nano Banana.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.760
That has everyone buy inputs on Adobe,

00:11.760 --> 00:13.800
because Photoshop is officially dead.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.040
Instead of learning how to use all these antique tools,

00:16.040 --> 00:18.600
you can now just prompt Nano Banana for changes,

00:18.600 --> 00:21.760
and it's able to deliver any photo alterations you can imagine.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.400
And most importantly, while maintaining the consistency

00:24.400 --> 00:25.520
of the original image.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.560
If you're an animator or graphic designer,

00:27.560 --> 00:29.760
this can unlock massive productivity gains.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.000
Like if you wanted to steal some meat canyon art

00:32.000 --> 00:33.280
and make it do something else,

00:33.280 --> 00:35.400
you can now accomplish that with a single prompt.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.640
No talent, necessary.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.240
Google is finally back to its roots building cool stuff,

00:39.240 --> 00:42.040
and Flash 2.5 is a tool that makes stable diffusion

00:42.040 --> 00:43.480
look like Microsoft's paint.

00:43.480 --> 00:46.240
In today's video, we'll take a look at all of its capabilities

00:46.240 --> 00:49.000
and find out if our Adobe puts will actually print.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.600
It is August 29th, 2025, and you are watching the code report.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.200
Not only is Nano Banana an exceptional image model

00:55.200 --> 00:57.720
that's already at the top of the L.M. Arena leaderboard,

00:57.840 --> 01:00.080
but it's also extremely fast and affordable,

01:00.080 --> 01:03.480
costing only 3.9 cents per image via the API.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.720
And hypothetically, Google is also trained

01:05.720 --> 01:07.800
in even more powerful Grondavenan app,

01:07.800 --> 01:10.440
but it's unlikely the common man will ever get access to it.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.520
The upgrade that most people are talking about, though,

01:12.520 --> 01:14.160
is character consistency.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.160
If you start with an image of a person or pet, for example,

01:17.160 --> 01:19.200
the model can blend it with a different image

01:19.200 --> 01:20.600
or make minor changes to it

01:20.600 --> 01:23.040
without noticeably altering the original character.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.760
Or multiple characters and objects,

01:24.760 --> 01:27.680
like this guy did by blending 13 different images together.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.760
That means if you want to link to

01:28.760 --> 01:30.720
and headshot of yourself wearing a nice suit,

01:30.720 --> 01:32.680
but can't afford to buy an actual suit,

01:32.680 --> 01:34.160
Nano Banana has you covered.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.280
In addition, if you work for the shadow government,

01:36.280 --> 01:38.560
it can be used to implement Mandela effects,

01:38.560 --> 01:41.320
like removing the cornacopia from the fruit of the loom logo.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.640
That's cool, but if you're wanna be game developer,

01:43.640 --> 01:46.040
one of the main showstoppers is the insane amount of time

01:46.040 --> 01:48.680
it takes to build up a collection of good-looking assets

01:48.680 --> 01:50.440
for all your characters and animations.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.440
Well, now, if you start with a base character,

01:52.440 --> 01:54.080
you can prompt all the different positions

01:54.080 --> 01:55.680
required for an animation.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.880
Or better yet, just have Gemini generate

01:57.880 --> 02:00.520
an entire sprite for you with all of them in a single prompt.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.360
They keep in mind though, if you go this route,

02:02.360 --> 02:04.720
you'll have to disclose any AI assets used

02:04.720 --> 02:06.000
when you publish on Steam.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.280
And you can't lie about it because anything generated

02:08.280 --> 02:11.280
with Google has an invisible watermark called SynthID.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.880
What's kind of crazy about this model though

02:12.880 --> 02:15.600
is that it also has an understanding of the real world.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.520
Like if you point to a spot on Google Maps

02:17.520 --> 02:19.120
and ask what a person would see there,

02:19.120 --> 02:20.800
it can generate a realistic photo.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.760
Or if you're a visual learner, you can sketch with it

02:22.760 --> 02:23.600
step by step.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.520
Like you could use the sketch tool to map out

02:25.520 --> 02:27.000
your AWS infrastructure.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.040
It's also pretty decent handling text,

02:29.040 --> 02:30.560
so you can easily turn your images

02:30.560 --> 02:32.600
into lame Instagram ads or memes.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.760
But it's still not perfect,

02:33.760 --> 02:35.400
so now let's talk about the bad stuff.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.840
As you can see in my ad here,

02:36.840 --> 02:40.160
it has a tendency to add extra characters to certain words.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.680
In addition, I found that it often didn't follow my prompt

02:42.680 --> 02:44.800
exactly and just kind of did its own thing.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.680
Or in many cases, it just ignored the prompt

02:46.680 --> 02:47.600
and did nothing at all.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.600
And I think even the character consistency is a bit overhyped.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.200
I tried it on a bunch of different images of real humans,

02:53.200 --> 02:56.440
and it still has that obvious AI uncanny valley look to it.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.680
And finally, as expected, as a Google product,

02:58.680 --> 03:00.880
it's highly censored trying to generate anything

03:00.880 --> 03:03.440
that's not safe for work is not going to happen.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.840
But the best way to get the most out of these AI tools

03:05.840 --> 03:07.640
is to learn how they work under the hood.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.520
And you can do that for free with brilliant

03:09.520 --> 03:11.160
the sponsor of today's video.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.760
They're how AI workscores

03:12.760 --> 03:14.960
teaches you how to build a functioning language model

03:14.960 --> 03:17.280
from scratch, and lets you experiment with things

03:17.280 --> 03:20.520
like feature vectors to edit facial expressions and images.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.000
This hands-on approach to learning

03:22.000 --> 03:24.600
helps you master challenging concepts over time.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.840
And is proven to be six times more effective

03:26.840 --> 03:28.560
than watching video lectures.
