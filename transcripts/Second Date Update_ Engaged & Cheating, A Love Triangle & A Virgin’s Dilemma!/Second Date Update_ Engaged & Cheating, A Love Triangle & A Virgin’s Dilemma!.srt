1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Hello, yeah, I was looking for Pete. Yeah, this Pete Pete what's up dude?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,240
This is jubble from Brook and jubble in the morning. I'm moving 92.5. How are you?

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,960
Um, good. Why are you calling?

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,880
Uh, I want to talk to you about a mutual friend that you and I have.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,720
Okay, it's a girl named Hannah

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,480
Why are you calling me about Hannah?

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,920
Well, I know that you went on a date with Hannah and you guys hooked up and the next morning you made her breakfast and everything

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,640
seemed cool and and haven't called her so I was calling kind of on Hannah's behalf to ask

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,080
why haven't we got back to work?

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,800
It's just on an error right now. It's just on the radio right now. Yeah, it is.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,600
Okay, I gotta go. Sorry. No, no, no, no, hang on. Hang on.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
Pete, Pete, one second, dude. Please don't hang up.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,120
Paul again.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,800
Dude, Hannah, what did you do?

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,600
There's not one to talk about Hannah.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,600
See, we're gonna back.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,960
This is inappropriate, man.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,040
Look, don't hang up. Don't hang up.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,840
No, no, it's bull.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,040
You shouldn't be asking me about my private life here. It's bull.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,600
Okay.

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,240
I mean, off the air.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,200
Hang on a second, Pete.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,480
What is this?

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,720
Okay. Uh, producer boy just had to be a piece of paper.

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,080
Let's true.

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,440
Yeah.

28
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,920
Really?

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,400
Yes.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:32,880
Um, apparently Pete, our producer went to your Facebook and it says, you are engaged.

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,600
What?

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,640
You're joking.

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,920
Is this for real?

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,640
Oh, my.

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,080
Pete, are you engaged, dude?

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,440
You hung up.

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,120
I heard it, cause I'm thinking you hung up.

38
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,920
Are you joking?

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,080
Wow.

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,400
That was weird.

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,880
All right, we're gonna stop for a second.

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,480
I'm trying to sort this out.

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,040
I think we need to figure out if this is really true or not.

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,360
Okay. So we got an update.

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,120
A few minutes ago during the second day of update,

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,320
we were calling Pete to find out why he wasn't calling Hannah Beck.

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,800
He hung up on us when we first got him on the phone.

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,440
So producer boy went to his Facebook page to try to get it like another contact form,

49
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,840
a phone number or something and found out through Pete's Facebook that he was actually engaged.

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,200
And apparently producer boy then message to his fiance

51
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,560
and he's telling me that she's on the phone right now.

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,000
Is she really on the phone?

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,160
Yeah.

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,880
She's on one, too.

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,320
Is this Jessica?

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,840
Yeah.

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,760
Do you have a fiance named Pete?

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you want to have a fiance named Pete?

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,400
Yeah.

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,600
I don't want to do it.

61
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,680
This is doable from Rick and Jubilee in the morning.

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,960
I'm moving 92.5.

63
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,560
Can you describe Pete for me?

64
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,080
He's my fiance.

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,240
We've been together for a while.

66
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,080
We're getting married in the summer.

67
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,040
He's okay.

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,240
It's really great.

69
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,120
Um, just like why are you asking me those?

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,560
This is how long you've been together.

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,200
While we've been engaged for about a year or a little over a year.

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm here.

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,240
Hang on Hannah.

74
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,280
Hang on Hannah.

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
Let's make sure this is the right dude.

76
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,400
All right.

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
Who is this?

78
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,040
This is Brook and Jubilee in the morning.

79
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
I'm moving 92.5.

80
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,840
Hannah's on the phone with us.

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,720
Hannah emailed us about a guy that she went out with and hooked up with.

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Who wouldn't call her back after they, you know, had a night of fun.

83
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,120
That guy is your fiance.

84
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,440
Is this a joke?

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,720
No.

86
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,480
Are you kidding me?

87
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,280
That's not possible.

88
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,520
Um, is there any way you've been out of town over the weekends?

89
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,280
Yeah.

90
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,840
When did this happen, Hannah?

91
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,840
On Friday night.

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:50,960
Okay.

93
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,640
Were you with Pete on Friday night?

94
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,800
No.

95
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,920
And he, oh my god.

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,160
I know, honey.

97
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,000
And he didn't answer my phone calls or my text on Friday.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,560
And are you, are you got, is this, it's not real?

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,160
Jessica, so you, where did Pete tell you he was on Friday night?

100
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,920
He said he had to work late.

101
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,640
Okay.

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,360
And he didn't answer any of my text or anything.

103
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,160
And, oh my god, are you kidding me?

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,000
Hannah, tell Jessica about what you did Friday night.

105
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,960
I'm really sorry.

106
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,920
I honestly had no idea if this time was engaged.

107
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,400
I thought he was just a great guy and we went on a date.

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,640
We went back, you went on a date.

109
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,080
Like a pre-arranged date.

110
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,120
What, you, I'm trying very hard to give him the benefit of the doubt and not freak out right now.

111
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,960
What's Pete's last name?

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,280
Jessica, what's Pete's last name?

113
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,000
We'll beat it up.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,400
Hannah, what's the guy's last name that you went out with?

115
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,960
I'm a, oh.

116
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,240
Are you kidding me?

117
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,280
Have you guys had any problems with cheating before in your, no?

118
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,120
And I'm aware of?

119
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
Hannah, how did you, how did you meet Pete again?

120
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,000
No, mutual acquaintance.

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,960
mutual acquaintance.

122
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,120
Who?

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,320
Who?

124
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,080
Disguh, Charles.

125
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,440
Jessica is Charles a friend of Pete's that, you know?

126
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,120
Yeah, he's a friend of Pete's.

127
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,280
He's a friend of Pete's that I don't get along with.

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,280
Unbelievable.

129
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
This is, we tried to cut.

130
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,720
Go out on a date.

131
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,240
Are you saying you were at a party?

132
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
Are you, I don't understand what you're saying to me.

133
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,720
Jessica, I would tell you to not get mad at Hannah because it sounds like Hannah legitimately

134
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,160
didn't know that he had a fiance.

135
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,320
So it's, I'm sorry.

136
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,160
I don't know who I'm mad at right now.

137
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,760
I'm just in shock, okay?

138
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,960
Cut me some f*** black hair because if you were in my house Hannah,

139
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,360
PS, you can be as mad as my house.

140
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,040
Wait, Jessica, you live there?

141
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,480
Wait, but you have to, I don't, no pictures of any gold in that house.

142
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,640
Oh my god.

143
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,200
Oh my god.

144
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,200
Are you okay, honey?

145
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,640
No, I'm not okay.

146
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm not okay, I'm in the hands, I'm not okay at all.

147
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,720
Oh, that makes my heart hurt.

148
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,200
I feel so.

149
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,120
We tried to get Pete on the phone.

150
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,160
Jessica to talk about why he wasn't calling Hannah back and he got angry and hung up on us

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,720
obviously because he has a fiance.

152
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
I'm sorry you had to hear about it this way.

153
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,440
I am too.

154
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,040
Hey, Jessica, we're gonna give you just a second to compose yourself, okay?

155
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
And then we're gonna talk to you a little more, right?

156
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,440
Okay, okay, I'm gonna put it all for one second.

157
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,320
Okay.

158
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,000
All right.

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,480
All right, this is the third segment of the second date update today because obviously

160
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,320
things got a little serious.

161
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,400
Hannah went out with a guy named Peter.

162
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,440
They hooked up.

163
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,320
We tried to get him on the phone, he got mad and hung up on us and then we found out that he actually had a fiance.

164
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,080
Jessica, how are you doing?

165
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,360
Yeah, I'm okay.

166
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,640
I'm, have you slept during engagement ring down the toilet yet?

167
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,240
Not yet.

168
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,960
Not yet.

169
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,440
Not yet.

170
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,400
Have you suspected him cheating before anything else?

171
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,000
I've had my moments of worrying about that a little bit but I've always told myself to

172
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,440
take the high road and not be accusatory.

173
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,520
Yeah, I would trust the commitment that we've made to each of you should be able to.

174
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,480
What is your plan, Jessica, for confronting Pete?

175
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,640
I don't know yet.

176
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,400
I don't, I just found it.

177
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,240
I don't know.

178
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:42,800
I am, my blood is boiling though right now and I am, I don't know if I am going to pack my stuff and just get out of here

179
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,480
or I'm just going to, Jessica, Jessica, I'm going to tell you from a guy's point of view

180
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,240
who has been caught cheating when he's been living with girls that he's been with.

181
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,000
Just walk away.

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,080
Like honestly, that's the best way to do it for both of you guys because you leave,

183
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,680
you can find someone else who's not going to cheat on you and if you don't leave

184
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,200
then you're always going to have that doubt.

185
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,400
You're always going to be on his case.

186
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,640
It's not going to be a good relationship on either side.

187
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,800
So no matter what, now that you know this, my advice to you would be just to go there when he's

188
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,040
not there, get your stuff, don't even give him the satisfaction of a conversation about it.

189
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,320
Because all he's going to do is lie about it.

190
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,520
Right?

191
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,040
I mean, how many times have you been honest,

192
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,480
you pull when you had gotten caught and cheated?

193
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,440
I am never honest.

194
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
So Jessica, that's what I would tell you to do, okay?

195
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,120
Thank you.

196
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,240
I mean, I guess I'm glad I'm finding this out.

197
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,080
I'm not at all, but yeah.

198
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,880
Hey, it's better to know now than to have to get a divorce, right?

199
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,160
And let me tell you, we through one badass, un-bachelorette party in Vegas after my girlfriend broke

200
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,360
up with her second fiance.

201
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,880
And it was way more fun.

202
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,080
Hey, Jessica, will you stay in touch with us?

203
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,720
Just to let us know how you're doing and how everything wraps up?

204
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,080
Yeah.

205
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,560
All right.

206
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,520
You're going to be okay.

207
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,880
Thanks, guys.

208
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
Yeah, it's not the end of the world.

209
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,040
It really isn't.

210
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,400
I know it sucks right now, but it's not.

211
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,080
Hello?

212
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,200
Hey, I was looking for Phil.

213
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,360
Yeah, speaking.

214
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,920
Who is this?

215
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
This is Jubel from Brook and Jubel in the morning.

216
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,120
I'm moving 92.5.

217
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,520
How are you?

218
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,600
92.5.

219
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,800
Oh my god, are you serious?

220
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:14,800
Wow.

221
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,040
Yes, I, this is the reaction I get when I call most people.

222
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, don't worry about it.

223
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,640
What's up, man?

224
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,200
How are you doing?

225
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,040
I'm great.

226
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,080
How are you?

227
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,720
Good.

228
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,920
Do you know why I might be calling you?

229
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,760
You know I do it.

230
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,000
Have you ever heard one of the second-aid updates that we do?

231
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,560
Kind of, it kind of sort of, yeah.

232
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,800
Do you sounds like you're not too familiar?

233
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,840
If you don't know what a second-aid update is, it's where you go out and date with someone

234
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,440
and then blow them off after.

235
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,880
Then they email us and ask us to call you to find out why.

236
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
So I'd do somebody off?

237
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,880
Yep.

238
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,400
Any idea what that could be?

239
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,560
Um, geez.

240
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
I mean, I didn't kind of go on a date like last week.

241
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,000
This girl Rachel.

242
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,160
And has Rachel texted you and called you after the date to try to maybe hang out again?

243
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,800
There's a couple times, uh, I think she may have left me a message.

244
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,880
And you haven't responded to her, which technically means you blew her off.

245
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,720
So you, we are.

246
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,360
What's that?

247
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,000
Great.

248
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,200
Men's brains work.

249
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,640
Oh, yeah.

250
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,520
Is that what?

251
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,360
Rachel wants to know why you won't call her back.

252
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,480
Is there any particular reason?

253
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,880
Well, man, to be completely honest, man.

254
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,600
You know, she was just a little weird.

255
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
She was a little weird.

256
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,440
What?

257
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,800
I figured that it was embarrassment.

258
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
I figured you weren't calling her back because you were embarrassed.

259
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
But you say it's because she's weird.

260
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, it turns out, you know, like all the stuff that we talked about.

261
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,240
She didn't really tell me everything about herself, you know, like pertinent information.

262
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,840
So what do you mean by that?

263
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,600
What do you mean by everything about herself?

264
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,320
You go on dates because, you know, you want to get to know somebody a little bit better.

265
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,240
Maybe you see if it leaves something else.

266
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,440
Yeah, I was going to say hook up after it.

267
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,640
But, uh, friends, somebody will have different reasons for dating.

268
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,760
So what do you find out about it?

269
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Like, you know, so after the date, you know, I went back and went to my friends and I was like,

270
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,360
you know, I went out with this awesome girl named Rachel and I actually showed them a picture of her.

271
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,960
And uh, a boy was like, this is the same girl that was dating a mutual friend of ours.

272
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,400
Oh, man.

273
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,760
All right, hold on.

274
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,840
How do you guys really know that that's the same person?

275
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,560
Facebook?

276
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Yeah, I could pick a pull picture right now.

277
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,920
We actually found the profile with boyfriend, right?

278
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,880
And we were going through his pictures.

279
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,080
She's on the profile picture making out with home dude.

280
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,640
What?

281
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,000
Wait, so she's cheated?

282
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,800
Yeah, apparently the status thing, there's a relationship and it says her name.

283
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,840
Oh, no.

284
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
And not even just dating him.

285
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,920
Wait, no, wait, I'm playing.

286
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,720
Hey, Phil.

287
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,640
Yeah.

288
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,160
I should probably, you know, that Rachel is on the other line and heard everything that you just said.

289
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,560
Are you serious?

290
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,400
So he, yeah, I, Phil, hi.

291
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
He was just, let me explain.

292
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,840
Yes, that was my boyfriend, but we're definitely not dating anymore.

293
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
We've been broken up for the last two months.

294
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,040
I just lived with him.

295
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,080
It was a little bit of a complicated situation, but we're definitely not in a relationship.

296
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,680
Rachel, did you say you just live with him?

297
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,600
Yeah, it's a little complicated, you know, but yeah, I live with him, but we're not together.

298
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,400
We're not officially to get broke up.

299
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,440
It's over.

300
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,240
It's been over.

301
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,400
Well, why are you living with him?

302
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,840
It's just a little complicated.

303
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm moving out soon.

304
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,880
We know I'm working it out, but for right now, we're still, you know, sharing the same space.

305
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,960
And how soon is soon?

306
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,640
Like, as soon as I possibly can.

307
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,040
Rachel, I've been in a similar situation where I've broken up with someone I lived with and we

308
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,160
had to live together for a couple of months because, you know, things just didn't work out.

309
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,400
Are you guys still sleeping together?

310
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,720
Yeah.

311
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,040
Well, I mean, sometimes, I get that when you admit it, that's not a problem.

312
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,880
At least you're on as a, and it's obvious.

313
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,760
It only, it's like, happened like once or twice.

314
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,960
And honestly, like, it's not an emotional thing at all.

315
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,000
It's just a physical thing.

316
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,040
I mean, you know, like, we do see each other every single day.

317
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,520
Right.

318
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,240
When I say that we're officially over, it we're a physical person.

319
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,280
I'm glad that you admit it because I give you said no, I was going to call you out because

320
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,920
this is the same way.

321
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,960
I would not have been in that situation.

322
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,480
You have your moments of weakness, you know.

323
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,800
Yeah, she says it's physical, but you have an ex boyfriend that still has a profile pick.

324
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,280
Yeah.

325
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,560
That is not physical to him.

326
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,680
I can guarantee it.

327
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,080
I mean, yeah, but I mean, I don't want to.

328
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,680
I don't want to why he still has that on there.

329
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,320
Because he still would love with you and a little obsessed.

330
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,280
And he's so banging.

331
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,920
Yeah.

332
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,160
Yeah.

333
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,320
I know that's another good point.

334
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,880
I mean, I guess, but I have, I changed my Facebook profile.

335
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,640
For me, it's definitely over.

336
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,200
And for me, I definitely want to date.

337
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,560
Phil, I really liked him.

338
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,480
I had a really good time on our date.

339
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,680
I would love to see him again and see where this can go.

340
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,600
And I thought we had a really good time.

341
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
If you're doing this to this guy, you know,

342
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,920
what's the say that you're not going to do this to me in a couple of months?

343
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Yeah, I mean, you can say that.

344
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,360
I understand we're coming from, but it's a very particular situation.

345
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,840
I can tell it to you in detail later off the radio if you want, but I mean,

346
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,640
just give me a chance, you know.

347
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,440
Hey, Rachel.

348
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,240
Oh, God.

349
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,080
How about you explain to Phil all about your relationship or ex relationship on your next date?

350
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,560
Because I would love to offer you guys a second date.

351
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,520
We will pay for it.

352
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:37,920
Phil?

353
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,520
It's not so painful.

354
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
Would you go out with Rachel again?

355
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,760
I got to say no, man.

356
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,480
Oh, no.

357
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,840
You do not blame him.

358
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,720
In a second date full of listening about her ex boyfriend.

359
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,400
That sounds horrible.

360
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,360
Sounds like a lot of fun.

361
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,880
I mean, he didn't come on Phil.

362
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,800
I got to say no because because this is the tables were turned, you know, I can't pull something

363
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,760
like that off.

364
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,640
Yeah, right.

365
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,760
Oh, I got a girlfriend, but you know, I want to go out and date you.

366
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,640
Like no, also.

367
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,520
Everyone, everybody would be calling you a huge D bag at the moment.

368
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,720
Yeah.

369
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,160
Rachel, maybe you should wait to date until you actually move out.

370
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,880
Yeah, you're probably right.

371
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,160
I, this is getting really complicated and making pretty impossible for me to meet anyone.

372
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,000
It's often complicated to date when you're still sleeping with your old boyfriend.

373
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,360
Hello, Kevin.

374
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,400
Hey, Kevin, how are you?

375
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,440
This is Jubel from Brook and Jubel in the morning on Moven 92.5.

376
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,400
Who?

377
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,680
Jubel from Brook and Jubel in the morning on the radio station Moven 92.5.

378
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,320
Have you heard of us?

379
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,720
Now I have.

380
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,560
Awesome.

381
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,280
Well, start.

382
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
We also morning radio show from 6 to 10.

383
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,840
You should check it out, especially since you're going to be on it right now.

384
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,040
Yeah.

385
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,640
I want to talk to you about a girl that you recently went on a date with.

386
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,640
Okay.

387
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,080
Her name is Stacey.

388
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,480
Now, we do a segment on her show called the second date update.

389
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,080
When somebody goes out on a date with someone they really like and then gets blown off,

390
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,520
they email us to call that person and find out why Stacey is wondering why you won't

391
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,000
call her back.

392
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,120
Oh, okay.

393
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
Do you remember going on a date with a girl named F.

394
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,080
Law and accurate cause?

395
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,880
Yes.

396
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,400
Did you do something wrong on the date?

397
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:30,160
I mean, let's just say she's a little fast for me.

398
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,960
So fast for you?

399
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,560
Yeah.

400
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,600
And I'm assuming you don't mean like, you should think she could run a mile

401
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,400
quicker than you like.

402
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,600
No, no.

403
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,840
We had a lovely evening that was going very well.

404
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:52,800
And then things proceeded like they do when an evening is going very well.

405
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,800
And then it just started to to get a little too heated.

406
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,320
How's it work?

407
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,840
She said that you were watching a movie and you guys started to kiss a little bit.

408
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,040
Yeah.

409
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,320
And then in the middle of that kissing your upstairs neighbors decided to do more than

410
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,440
kissing very loud.

411
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,080
Yeah.

412
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,760
And there was an awkward moment.

413
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,200
She said she made a joke and like, oh, maybe it's a sign.

414
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,840
And then you didn't laugh at it and she thought maybe she upset you.

415
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,600
Alright, I'll be totally honest there.

416
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,320
Uh, I'm trying to save

417
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,680
myself.

418
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,960
Oh, you're okay.

419
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,840
Okay.

420
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,360
So you're saving yourself from Mary.

421
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,560
Nothing wrong with that.

422
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,560
There's a lot of things.

423
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
I was going to tell you all the problems.

424
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,840
It's wrong with the guys.

425
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,880
You're saving yourself from Mary, you're virgin.

426
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,200
Yes, yes, I'm a virgin.

427
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,800
So did you not get her joke?

428
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,760
I mean, she was just joking about it being a sign that you guys should do it.

429
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,280
No, she didn't really seem like it was a joke.

430
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,240
I mean, it was it was said, but there was a little more intention behind the joke.

431
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,320
And things just got pretty awkward pretty quickly.

432
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,240
And I realized, you know, as wonderful as she is, she's the kind of girl that might want to move

433
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,280
faster than I would be able to.

434
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,840
And she's incredibly attractive.

435
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,040
She's in this.

436
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,000
So that kind of temptation is incredibly hard to fight.

437
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,480
How do you get that impression, though, Kevin, that she is that kind of girl?

438
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,960
Well, it was heard that sort of initiated the kissing.

439
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,720
I'm a big fan of kissing.

440
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,080
So I wasn't really going to stop because I was like,

441
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,680
she's incredibly attractive.

442
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,960
And what's all you got right now?

443
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,680
Yeah, I was like, I was like, bracing, right?

444
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,640
I mean, I was definitely very tempted.

445
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,000
And there was definitely the kind of girl that my mom always warned me about.

446
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,640
Oh, guys.

447
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,640
Kevin, what are you?

448
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,000
What do you mean?

449
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,880
I'm old enough to make my own decision.

450
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,080
Yeah, you know, I do still hold onto the lessons my mom teach me.

451
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,840
Right. And Kevin, I'm assuming that since you met Stacey at church,

452
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,040
you're a pretty churchy guy.

453
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,880
I'm a fairly, you know, I'm a fairly churchy guy.

454
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,120
That is pretty religious.

455
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,400
A churchy is always like that.

456
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,200
So you just feel that she is way too loose of a woman.

457
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,000
Pretty cute.

458
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,800
I guess I think she, I mean, I'm not that too my own horn.

459
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,280
You're much better.

460
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,800
Just don't think she'd be able to control herself.

461
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,920
There comes a down here.

462
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,960
There's a person.

463
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,280
Hey, Eric, it's virgin.

464
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,720
Kevin?

465
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,480
Yes, sir.

466
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,840
I do have to let you know that Stacey is actually online.

467
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,160
And we heard everything you just said.

468
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,600
Good.

469
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,000
Lord.

470
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,040
That does not have been in vain.

471
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,840
Yeah, agree.

472
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,800
Hey, Stacey.

473
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,640
Then say hi to Kevin.

474
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,240
Oh boy.

475
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,600
Kevin, so that's the reason, huh?

476
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:54,240
I mean, do you have any idea what you're missing album?

477
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
No, he doesn't.

478
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Yeah.

479
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,720
It's just no sex or something that I'm firmly, I firmly believe that it's something that you

480
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:11,360
want to save because it's special and it shouldn't be just paused to the side at any moment.

481
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,960
It should be something that people really want to do for the right reason.

482
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,320
I mean, if you think kissing is great.

483
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,400
Stacey, you're not saying that you want a date of virgin.

484
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
You're saying that you want a convertive virgin.

485
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,280
No, no, that is not what I'm saying.

486
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,040
Kevin, you're searching for another virgin.

487
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,640
I wouldn't necessarily say another virgin per se, but definitely someone that holds the same values

488
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,720
or at least be able to hold to the same values.

489
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:50,000
Kevin, to be honest, we had such a great time with our private pizza making party and pizza

490
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,760
bite and everything.

491
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,520
I cannot believe I'm going to say this, but I would actually be willing to give up

492
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,800
sex to go out with you again.

493
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,600
Kevin, you've actually made a woman not want to have sex ever again.

494
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,760
Kevin's crazy.

495
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,720
Now, I have to tell you your body was telling me something completely different.

496
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,600
Oh, well, and I don't know if I'm being word.

497
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,120
You truly restrained yourself.

498
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,040
She's not going to take you to the room.

499
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,200
Just, you know, have her way with you.

500
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,440
Yeah, like you have a little bit of a saying it too.

501
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,200
And Kevin, are you crazy?

502
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,600
Like, how many women are offering this for you?

503
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,120
I mean, I don't know many girls that would just stop having sex because they

504
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,480
meet a guy who's that great.

505
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,480
Thank you.

506
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,600
Like, Brooke, she's got a husband and she still has sex with dudes all the time.

507
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,560
You know, like she doesn't stop for him.

508
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,960
Yeah, yeah.

509
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,680
Good, Kevin.

510
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,320
I know you say you're going to be able to wait, but just from what you'd said,

511
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,400
a second ago, look at what you're giving up.

512
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
So I just questioned that.

513
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,960
That's all.

514
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,480
I think you should have a little faith.

515
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,080
Oh, good line.

516
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,600
Stay as you just want to take it.

517
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,560
Yeah.

518
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,760
I'm not going to take it.

519
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,720
You just want to take it.

520
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,360
I'm not going to take it.

521
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,560
I want that big card.

522
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,360
All right.

523
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,560
Well, that being said, would love to offer you guys the second date?

524
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,320
We will pay for it.

525
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,120
If I say, yeah, you think we'd be able to control ourselves.

526
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,520
I do.

527
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,080
I promise.

528
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,960
All right, let's do it.

529
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,240
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

530
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,600
You're going to go out with Stacey again.

531
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,520
Let's do it.

532
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,560
Well, you're going to go out with her again.

533
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,440
You're not going to do it.

534
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:37,840
Yeah.

535
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,240
But you will go out on another date.

536
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,240
Wrong choice.

537
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,640
Sorry.

538
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,040
All right.

539
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,680
It's Stacey.

540
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,480
Well, congratulations.

541
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,200
You got your date.
