00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
Hello, yeah, I was looking for Pete. Yeah, this Pete Pete what's up dude?

00:04.960 --> 00:08.240
This is jubble from Brook and jubble in the morning. I'm moving 92.5. How are you?

00:10.640 --> 00:12.960
Um, good. Why are you calling?

00:13.680 --> 00:16.880
Uh, I want to talk to you about a mutual friend that you and I have.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.720
Okay, it's a girl named Hannah

00:22.800 --> 00:24.480
Why are you calling me about Hannah?

00:25.360 --> 00:29.920
Well, I know that you went on a date with Hannah and you guys hooked up and the next morning you made her breakfast and everything

00:29.920 --> 00:34.640
seemed cool and and haven't called her so I was calling kind of on Hannah's behalf to ask

00:35.200 --> 00:36.080
why haven't we got back to work?

00:37.520 --> 00:40.800
It's just on an error right now. It's just on the radio right now. Yeah, it is.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.600
Okay, I gotta go. Sorry. No, no, no, no, hang on. Hang on.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.760
Pete, Pete, one second, dude. Please don't hang up.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.120
Paul again.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.800
Dude, Hannah, what did you do?

00:56.240 --> 00:57.600
There's not one to talk about Hannah.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.600
See, we're gonna back.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.960
This is inappropriate, man.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.040
Look, don't hang up. Don't hang up.

01:07.040 --> 01:07.840
No, no, it's bull.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.040
You shouldn't be asking me about my private life here. It's bull.

01:11.040 --> 01:11.600
Okay.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.240
I mean, off the air.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.200
Hang on a second, Pete.

01:14.000 --> 01:14.480
What is this?

01:15.920 --> 01:18.720
Okay. Uh, producer boy just had to be a piece of paper.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.080
Let's true.

01:22.880 --> 01:23.440
Yeah.

01:23.440 --> 01:23.920
Really?

01:23.920 --> 01:24.400
Yes.

01:24.800 --> 01:32.880
Um, apparently Pete, our producer went to your Facebook and it says, you are engaged.

01:34.880 --> 01:35.600
What?

01:35.600 --> 01:36.640
You're joking.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.920
Is this for real?

01:37.920 --> 01:38.640
Oh, my.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.080
Pete, are you engaged, dude?

01:40.640 --> 01:41.440
You hung up.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.120
I heard it, cause I'm thinking you hung up.

01:43.120 --> 01:43.920
Are you joking?

01:44.560 --> 01:46.080
Wow.

01:47.680 --> 01:48.400
That was weird.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.880
All right, we're gonna stop for a second.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.480
I'm trying to sort this out.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.040
I think we need to figure out if this is really true or not.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.360
Okay. So we got an update.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.120
A few minutes ago during the second day of update,

01:59.840 --> 02:02.320
we were calling Pete to find out why he wasn't calling Hannah Beck.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.800
He hung up on us when we first got him on the phone.

02:04.800 --> 02:09.440
So producer boy went to his Facebook page to try to get it like another contact form,

02:09.440 --> 02:13.840
a phone number or something and found out through Pete's Facebook that he was actually engaged.

02:15.120 --> 02:19.200
And apparently producer boy then message to his fiance

02:19.600 --> 02:22.560
and he's telling me that she's on the phone right now.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.000
Is she really on the phone?

02:24.000 --> 02:24.160
Yeah.

02:24.160 --> 02:24.880
She's on one, too.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.320
Is this Jessica?

02:29.360 --> 02:29.840
Yeah.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.760
Do you have a fiance named Pete?

02:35.360 --> 02:38.000
Do you want to have a fiance named Pete?

02:38.000 --> 02:38.400
Yeah.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.600
I don't want to do it.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.680
This is doable from Rick and Jubilee in the morning.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.960
I'm moving 92.5.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.560
Can you describe Pete for me?

02:49.600 --> 02:52.080
He's my fiance.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.240
We've been together for a while.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.080
We're getting married in the summer.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.040
He's okay.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.240
It's really great.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.120
Um, just like why are you asking me those?

03:01.120 --> 03:02.560
This is how long you've been together.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.200
While we've been engaged for about a year or a little over a year.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.400
I'm here.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.240
Hang on Hannah.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.280
Hang on Hannah.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.800
Let's make sure this is the right dude.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.400
All right.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.600
Who is this?

03:15.600 --> 03:17.040
This is Brook and Jubilee in the morning.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.720
I'm moving 92.5.

03:18.880 --> 03:19.840
Hannah's on the phone with us.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.720
Hannah emailed us about a guy that she went out with and hooked up with.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.720
Who wouldn't call her back after they, you know, had a night of fun.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.120
That guy is your fiance.

03:30.800 --> 03:31.440
Is this a joke?

03:32.400 --> 03:32.720
No.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.480
Are you kidding me?

03:36.480 --> 03:37.280
That's not possible.

03:37.280 --> 03:43.520
Um, is there any way you've been out of town over the weekends?

03:44.960 --> 03:45.280
Yeah.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.840
When did this happen, Hannah?

03:48.880 --> 03:49.840
On Friday night.

03:50.480 --> 03:50.960
Okay.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.640
Were you with Pete on Friday night?

03:54.320 --> 03:54.800
No.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.920
And he, oh my god.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.160
I know, honey.

04:00.720 --> 04:04.000
And he didn't answer my phone calls or my text on Friday.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.560
And are you, are you got, is this, it's not real?

04:08.560 --> 04:12.160
Jessica, so you, where did Pete tell you he was on Friday night?

04:12.160 --> 04:13.920
He said he had to work late.

04:14.160 --> 04:14.640
Okay.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.360
And he didn't answer any of my text or anything.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.160
And, oh my god, are you kidding me?

04:20.160 --> 04:24.000
Hannah, tell Jessica about what you did Friday night.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.960
I'm really sorry.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.920
I honestly had no idea if this time was engaged.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.400
I thought he was just a great guy and we went on a date.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.640
We went back, you went on a date.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.080
Like a pre-arranged date.

04:36.080 --> 04:43.120
What, you, I'm trying very hard to give him the benefit of the doubt and not freak out right now.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.960
What's Pete's last name?

04:45.840 --> 04:47.280
Jessica, what's Pete's last name?

04:47.280 --> 04:48.000
We'll beat it up.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.400
Hannah, what's the guy's last name that you went out with?

04:53.440 --> 04:54.960
I'm a, oh.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.240
Are you kidding me?

04:58.800 --> 05:03.280
Have you guys had any problems with cheating before in your, no?

05:03.920 --> 05:05.120
And I'm aware of?

05:05.520 --> 05:07.520
Hannah, how did you, how did you meet Pete again?

05:08.320 --> 05:10.000
No, mutual acquaintance.

05:10.000 --> 05:10.960
mutual acquaintance.

05:10.960 --> 05:11.120
Who?

05:12.000 --> 05:12.320
Who?

05:13.200 --> 05:14.080
Disguh, Charles.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.440
Jessica is Charles a friend of Pete's that, you know?

05:17.440 --> 05:19.120
Yeah, he's a friend of Pete's.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.280
He's a friend of Pete's that I don't get along with.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.280
Unbelievable.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.440
This is, we tried to cut.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.720
Go out on a date.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.240
Are you saying you were at a party?

05:28.240 --> 05:30.560
Are you, I don't understand what you're saying to me.

05:30.560 --> 05:34.720
Jessica, I would tell you to not get mad at Hannah because it sounds like Hannah legitimately

05:34.720 --> 05:36.160
didn't know that he had a fiance.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.320
So it's, I'm sorry.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.160
I don't know who I'm mad at right now.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.760
I'm just in shock, okay?

05:42.320 --> 05:46.960
Cut me some f*** black hair because if you were in my house Hannah,

05:46.960 --> 05:49.360
PS, you can be as mad as my house.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.040
Wait, Jessica, you live there?

05:51.040 --> 05:54.480
Wait, but you have to, I don't, no pictures of any gold in that house.

05:55.920 --> 05:56.640
Oh my god.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.200
Oh my god.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.200
Are you okay, honey?

06:01.200 --> 06:02.640
No, I'm not okay.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.000
I'm not okay, I'm in the hands, I'm not okay at all.

06:11.760 --> 06:12.720
Oh, that makes my heart hurt.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.200
I feel so.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.120
We tried to get Pete on the phone.

06:17.120 --> 06:22.160
Jessica to talk about why he wasn't calling Hannah back and he got angry and hung up on us

06:22.160 --> 06:24.720
obviously because he has a fiance.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.440
I'm sorry you had to hear about it this way.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.440
I am too.

06:29.440 --> 06:33.040
Hey, Jessica, we're gonna give you just a second to compose yourself, okay?

06:33.040 --> 06:35.040
And then we're gonna talk to you a little more, right?

06:35.040 --> 06:37.440
Okay, okay, I'm gonna put it all for one second.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.320
Okay.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.000
All right.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.480
All right, this is the third segment of the second date update today because obviously

06:44.480 --> 06:46.320
things got a little serious.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.400
Hannah went out with a guy named Peter.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.440
They hooked up.

06:49.440 --> 06:54.320
We tried to get him on the phone, he got mad and hung up on us and then we found out that he actually had a fiance.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.080
Jessica, how are you doing?

06:56.080 --> 06:57.360
Yeah, I'm okay.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.640
I'm, have you slept during engagement ring down the toilet yet?

07:00.640 --> 07:02.240
Not yet.

07:02.240 --> 07:02.960
Not yet.

07:02.960 --> 07:03.440
Not yet.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.400
Have you suspected him cheating before anything else?

07:07.360 --> 07:14.000
I've had my moments of worrying about that a little bit but I've always told myself to

07:14.000 --> 07:17.440
take the high road and not be accusatory.

07:18.240 --> 07:23.520
Yeah, I would trust the commitment that we've made to each of you should be able to.

07:23.520 --> 07:26.480
What is your plan, Jessica, for confronting Pete?

07:27.520 --> 07:28.640
I don't know yet.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.400
I don't, I just found it.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.240
I don't know.

07:32.800 --> 07:42.800
I am, my blood is boiling though right now and I am, I don't know if I am going to pack my stuff and just get out of here

07:42.800 --> 07:48.480
or I'm just going to, Jessica, Jessica, I'm going to tell you from a guy's point of view

07:48.480 --> 07:52.240
who has been caught cheating when he's been living with girls that he's been with.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.000
Just walk away.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.080
Like honestly, that's the best way to do it for both of you guys because you leave,

07:58.080 --> 08:01.680
you can find someone else who's not going to cheat on you and if you don't leave

08:01.680 --> 08:03.200
then you're always going to have that doubt.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.400
You're always going to be on his case.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.640
It's not going to be a good relationship on either side.

08:07.200 --> 08:12.800
So no matter what, now that you know this, my advice to you would be just to go there when he's

08:12.800 --> 08:17.040
not there, get your stuff, don't even give him the satisfaction of a conversation about it.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.320
Because all he's going to do is lie about it.

08:19.040 --> 08:19.520
Right?

08:19.520 --> 08:21.040
I mean, how many times have you been honest,

08:21.040 --> 08:22.480
you pull when you had gotten caught and cheated?

08:22.480 --> 08:23.440
I am never honest.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.360
So Jessica, that's what I would tell you to do, okay?

08:28.560 --> 08:29.120
Thank you.

08:29.120 --> 08:34.240
I mean, I guess I'm glad I'm finding this out.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.080
I'm not at all, but yeah.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.880
Hey, it's better to know now than to have to get a divorce, right?

08:38.880 --> 08:44.160
And let me tell you, we through one badass, un-bachelorette party in Vegas after my girlfriend broke

08:44.160 --> 08:45.360
up with her second fiance.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.880
And it was way more fun.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.080
Hey, Jessica, will you stay in touch with us?

08:50.080 --> 08:52.720
Just to let us know how you're doing and how everything wraps up?

08:53.360 --> 08:54.080
Yeah.

08:54.080 --> 08:54.560
All right.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.520
You're going to be okay.

08:56.080 --> 08:56.880
Thanks, guys.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.320
Yeah, it's not the end of the world.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.040
It really isn't.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.400
I know it sucks right now, but it's not.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.080
Hello?

09:02.080 --> 09:03.200
Hey, I was looking for Phil.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.360
Yeah, speaking.

09:05.360 --> 09:05.920
Who is this?

09:06.480 --> 09:08.080
This is Jubel from Brook and Jubel in the morning.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.120
I'm moving 92.5.

09:09.120 --> 09:09.520
How are you?

09:10.320 --> 09:11.600
92.5.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.800
Oh my god, are you serious?

09:14.560 --> 09:14.800
Wow.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.040
Yes, I, this is the reaction I get when I call most people.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.000
Oh, don't worry about it.

09:20.000 --> 09:20.640
What's up, man?

09:20.640 --> 09:21.200
How are you doing?

09:21.920 --> 09:23.040
I'm great.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.080
How are you?

09:24.080 --> 09:24.720
Good.

09:24.720 --> 09:25.920
Do you know why I might be calling you?

09:26.640 --> 09:27.760
You know I do it.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.000
Have you ever heard one of the second-aid updates that we do?

09:31.040 --> 09:32.560
Kind of, it kind of sort of, yeah.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.800
Do you sounds like you're not too familiar?

09:34.800 --> 09:37.840
If you don't know what a second-aid update is, it's where you go out and date with someone

09:37.840 --> 09:39.440
and then blow them off after.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.880
Then they email us and ask us to call you to find out why.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.160
So I'd do somebody off?

09:46.160 --> 09:46.880
Yep.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.400
Any idea what that could be?

09:50.160 --> 09:52.560
Um, geez.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.560
I mean, I didn't kind of go on a date like last week.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.000
This girl Rachel.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.160
And has Rachel texted you and called you after the date to try to maybe hang out again?

10:03.120 --> 10:06.800
There's a couple times, uh, I think she may have left me a message.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.880
And you haven't responded to her, which technically means you blew her off.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.720
So you, we are.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.360
What's that?

10:13.360 --> 10:14.000
Great.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.200
Men's brains work.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.640
Oh, yeah.

10:16.640 --> 10:17.520
Is that what?

10:17.520 --> 10:19.360
Rachel wants to know why you won't call her back.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.480
Is there any particular reason?

10:22.160 --> 10:24.880
Well, man, to be completely honest, man.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.600
You know, she was just a little weird.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.640
She was a little weird.

10:28.640 --> 10:29.440
What?

10:29.440 --> 10:30.800
I figured that it was embarrassment.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.560
I figured you weren't calling her back because you were embarrassed.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.160
But you say it's because she's weird.

10:35.280 --> 10:39.040
Oh, yeah, yeah, it turns out, you know, like all the stuff that we talked about.

10:39.920 --> 10:46.240
She didn't really tell me everything about herself, you know, like pertinent information.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.840
So what do you mean by that?

10:47.840 --> 10:49.600
What do you mean by everything about herself?

10:50.640 --> 10:54.320
You go on dates because, you know, you want to get to know somebody a little bit better.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.240
Maybe you see if it leaves something else.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.440
Yeah, I was going to say hook up after it.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.640
But, uh, friends, somebody will have different reasons for dating.

11:00.640 --> 11:01.760
So what do you find out about it?

11:01.760 --> 11:07.760
Like, you know, so after the date, you know, I went back and went to my friends and I was like,

11:07.760 --> 11:13.360
you know, I went out with this awesome girl named Rachel and I actually showed them a picture of her.

11:13.760 --> 11:20.960
And uh, a boy was like, this is the same girl that was dating a mutual friend of ours.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.400
Oh, man.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.760
All right, hold on.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.840
How do you guys really know that that's the same person?

11:25.840 --> 11:26.560
Facebook?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.560
Yeah, I could pick a pull picture right now.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.920
We actually found the profile with boyfriend, right?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.880
And we were going through his pictures.

11:34.880 --> 11:38.080
She's on the profile picture making out with home dude.

11:38.080 --> 11:38.640
What?

11:38.640 --> 11:40.000
Wait, so she's cheated?

11:40.720 --> 11:46.800
Yeah, apparently the status thing, there's a relationship and it says her name.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.840
Oh, no.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.120
And not even just dating him.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.920
Wait, no, wait, I'm playing.

11:53.920 --> 11:54.720
Hey, Phil.

11:56.000 --> 11:56.640
Yeah.

11:56.640 --> 12:00.160
I should probably, you know, that Rachel is on the other line and heard everything that you just said.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.560
Are you serious?

12:02.560 --> 12:06.400
So he, yeah, I, Phil, hi.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.680
He was just, let me explain.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.840
Yes, that was my boyfriend, but we're definitely not dating anymore.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.840
We've been broken up for the last two months.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.040
I just lived with him.

12:17.200 --> 12:22.080
It was a little bit of a complicated situation, but we're definitely not in a relationship.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.680
Rachel, did you say you just live with him?

12:24.240 --> 12:29.600
Yeah, it's a little complicated, you know, but yeah, I live with him, but we're not together.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.400
We're not officially to get broke up.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.440
It's over.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.240
It's been over.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.400
Well, why are you living with him?

12:36.400 --> 12:37.840
It's just a little complicated.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.200
I'm moving out soon.

12:39.200 --> 12:44.880
We know I'm working it out, but for right now, we're still, you know, sharing the same space.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.960
And how soon is soon?

12:48.960 --> 12:50.640
Like, as soon as I possibly can.

12:50.640 --> 12:55.040
Rachel, I've been in a similar situation where I've broken up with someone I lived with and we

12:55.040 --> 12:58.160
had to live together for a couple of months because, you know, things just didn't work out.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.400
Are you guys still sleeping together?

13:00.400 --> 13:00.720
Yeah.

13:02.320 --> 13:09.040
Well, I mean, sometimes, I get that when you admit it, that's not a problem.

13:09.040 --> 13:12.880
At least you're on as a, and it's obvious.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.760
It only, it's like, happened like once or twice.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.960
And honestly, like, it's not an emotional thing at all.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.000
It's just a physical thing.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.040
I mean, you know, like, we do see each other every single day.

13:23.040 --> 13:23.520
Right.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.240
When I say that we're officially over, it we're a physical person.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.280
I'm glad that you admit it because I give you said no, I was going to call you out because

13:29.280 --> 13:29.920
this is the same way.

13:29.920 --> 13:30.960
I would not have been in that situation.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.480
You have your moments of weakness, you know.

13:32.480 --> 13:36.800
Yeah, she says it's physical, but you have an ex boyfriend that still has a profile pick.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.280
Yeah.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.560
That is not physical to him.

13:38.560 --> 13:39.680
I can guarantee it.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.080
I mean, yeah, but I mean, I don't want to.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.680
I don't want to why he still has that on there.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.320
Because he still would love with you and a little obsessed.

13:46.320 --> 13:47.280
And he's so banging.

13:47.280 --> 13:47.920
Yeah.

13:47.920 --> 13:48.160
Yeah.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.320
I know that's another good point.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.880
I mean, I guess, but I have, I changed my Facebook profile.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.640
For me, it's definitely over.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.200
And for me, I definitely want to date.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.560
Phil, I really liked him.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.480
I had a really good time on our date.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.680
I would love to see him again and see where this can go.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.600
And I thought we had a really good time.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.560
If you're doing this to this guy, you know,

14:11.120 --> 14:13.920
what's the say that you're not going to do this to me in a couple of months?

14:13.920 --> 14:15.920
Yeah, I mean, you can say that.

14:15.920 --> 14:19.360
I understand we're coming from, but it's a very particular situation.

14:19.360 --> 14:23.840
I can tell it to you in detail later off the radio if you want, but I mean,

14:24.800 --> 14:26.640
just give me a chance, you know.

14:26.640 --> 14:27.440
Hey, Rachel.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.240
Oh, God.

14:28.240 --> 14:34.080
How about you explain to Phil all about your relationship or ex relationship on your next date?

14:34.080 --> 14:36.560
Because I would love to offer you guys a second date.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.520
We will pay for it.

14:37.520 --> 14:37.920
Phil?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.520
It's not so painful.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.800
Would you go out with Rachel again?

14:42.160 --> 14:43.760
I got to say no, man.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.480
Oh, no.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.840
You do not blame him.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.720
In a second date full of listening about her ex boyfriend.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.400
That sounds horrible.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.360
Sounds like a lot of fun.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.880
I mean, he didn't come on Phil.

14:53.840 --> 14:58.800
I got to say no because because this is the tables were turned, you know, I can't pull something

14:58.800 --> 14:59.760
like that off.

14:59.760 --> 15:00.640
Yeah, right.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.760
Oh, I got a girlfriend, but you know, I want to go out and date you.

15:03.760 --> 15:04.640
Like no, also.

15:05.600 --> 15:09.520
Everyone, everybody would be calling you a huge D bag at the moment.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.720
Yeah.

15:10.720 --> 15:14.160
Rachel, maybe you should wait to date until you actually move out.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.880
Yeah, you're probably right.

15:16.880 --> 15:22.160
I, this is getting really complicated and making pretty impossible for me to meet anyone.

15:22.160 --> 15:26.000
It's often complicated to date when you're still sleeping with your old boyfriend.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.360
Hello, Kevin.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.400
Hey, Kevin, how are you?

15:30.400 --> 15:33.440
This is Jubel from Brook and Jubel in the morning on Moven 92.5.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.400
Who?

15:36.400 --> 15:41.680
Jubel from Brook and Jubel in the morning on the radio station Moven 92.5.

15:41.680 --> 15:42.320
Have you heard of us?

15:44.080 --> 15:44.720
Now I have.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.560
Awesome.

15:46.560 --> 15:47.280
Well, start.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.280
We also morning radio show from 6 to 10.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.840
You should check it out, especially since you're going to be on it right now.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.040
Yeah.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.640
I want to talk to you about a girl that you recently went on a date with.

15:57.840 --> 15:58.640
Okay.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.080
Her name is Stacey.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.480
Now, we do a segment on her show called the second date update.

16:02.560 --> 16:06.080
When somebody goes out on a date with someone they really like and then gets blown off,

16:06.080 --> 16:11.520
they email us to call that person and find out why Stacey is wondering why you won't

16:11.520 --> 16:12.000
call her back.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.120
Oh, okay.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.880
Do you remember going on a date with a girl named F.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.080
Law and accurate cause?

16:20.080 --> 16:20.880
Yes.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.400
Did you do something wrong on the date?

16:23.440 --> 16:30.160
I mean, let's just say she's a little fast for me.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.960
So fast for you?

16:33.760 --> 16:34.560
Yeah.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.600
And I'm assuming you don't mean like, you should think she could run a mile

16:37.600 --> 16:38.400
quicker than you like.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.600
No, no.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.840
We had a lovely evening that was going very well.

16:45.840 --> 16:52.800
And then things proceeded like they do when an evening is going very well.

16:54.400 --> 16:58.800
And then it just started to to get a little too heated.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.320
How's it work?

17:00.320 --> 17:03.840
She said that you were watching a movie and you guys started to kiss a little bit.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.040
Yeah.

17:05.040 --> 17:10.320
And then in the middle of that kissing your upstairs neighbors decided to do more than

17:10.320 --> 17:11.440
kissing very loud.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.080
Yeah.

17:12.080 --> 17:13.760
And there was an awkward moment.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.200
She said she made a joke and like, oh, maybe it's a sign.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.840
And then you didn't laugh at it and she thought maybe she upset you.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.600
Alright, I'll be totally honest there.

17:23.600 --> 17:28.320
Uh, I'm trying to save

17:28.880 --> 17:29.680
myself.

17:29.680 --> 17:30.960
Oh, you're okay.

17:30.960 --> 17:31.840
Okay.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.360
So you're saving yourself from Mary.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.560
Nothing wrong with that.

17:35.840 --> 17:36.560
There's a lot of things.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.560
I was going to tell you all the problems.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.840
It's wrong with the guys.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.880
You're saving yourself from Mary, you're virgin.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.200
Yes, yes, I'm a virgin.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.800
So did you not get her joke?

17:46.800 --> 17:49.760
I mean, she was just joking about it being a sign that you guys should do it.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.280
No, she didn't really seem like it was a joke.

17:53.280 --> 17:58.240
I mean, it was it was said, but there was a little more intention behind the joke.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.320
And things just got pretty awkward pretty quickly.

18:02.960 --> 18:08.240
And I realized, you know, as wonderful as she is, she's the kind of girl that might want to move

18:08.640 --> 18:11.280
faster than I would be able to.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.840
And she's incredibly attractive.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.040
She's in this.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.000
So that kind of temptation is incredibly hard to fight.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.480
How do you get that impression, though, Kevin, that she is that kind of girl?

18:23.360 --> 18:26.960
Well, it was heard that sort of initiated the kissing.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.720
I'm a big fan of kissing.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.080
So I wasn't really going to stop because I was like,

18:32.080 --> 18:33.680
she's incredibly attractive.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.960
And what's all you got right now?

18:34.960 --> 18:37.680
Yeah, I was like, I was like, bracing, right?

18:38.320 --> 18:40.640
I mean, I was definitely very tempted.

18:40.640 --> 18:44.000
And there was definitely the kind of girl that my mom always warned me about.

18:44.000 --> 18:44.640
Oh, guys.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.640
Kevin, what are you?

18:48.640 --> 18:50.000
What do you mean?

18:51.040 --> 18:52.880
I'm old enough to make my own decision.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.080
Yeah, you know, I do still hold onto the lessons my mom teach me.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.840
Right. And Kevin, I'm assuming that since you met Stacey at church,

18:59.840 --> 19:01.040
you're a pretty churchy guy.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.880
I'm a fairly, you know, I'm a fairly churchy guy.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.120
That is pretty religious.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.400
A churchy is always like that.

19:09.520 --> 19:13.200
So you just feel that she is way too loose of a woman.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.000
Pretty cute.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.800
I guess I think she, I mean, I'm not that too my own horn.

19:16.800 --> 19:17.280
You're much better.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.800
Just don't think she'd be able to control herself.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.920
There comes a down here.

19:21.920 --> 19:22.960
There's a person.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.280
Hey, Eric, it's virgin.

19:26.320 --> 19:26.720
Kevin?

19:27.600 --> 19:28.480
Yes, sir.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.840
I do have to let you know that Stacey is actually online.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.160
And we heard everything you just said.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.600
Good.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.000
Lord.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.040
That does not have been in vain.

19:39.040 --> 19:39.840
Yeah, agree.

19:39.840 --> 19:40.800
Hey, Stacey.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.640
Then say hi to Kevin.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.240
Oh boy.

19:44.240 --> 19:47.600
Kevin, so that's the reason, huh?

19:47.680 --> 19:54.240
I mean, do you have any idea what you're missing album?

19:54.240 --> 19:56.240
No, he doesn't.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.240
Yeah.

19:58.240 --> 20:04.720
It's just no sex or something that I'm firmly, I firmly believe that it's something that you

20:04.720 --> 20:11.360
want to save because it's special and it shouldn't be just paused to the side at any moment.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.960
It should be something that people really want to do for the right reason.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.320
I mean, if you think kissing is great.

20:20.320 --> 20:24.400
Stacey, you're not saying that you want a date of virgin.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.400
You're saying that you want a convertive virgin.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.280
No, no, that is not what I'm saying.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.040
Kevin, you're searching for another virgin.

20:33.680 --> 20:38.640
I wouldn't necessarily say another virgin per se, but definitely someone that holds the same values

20:38.640 --> 20:40.720
or at least be able to hold to the same values.

20:41.360 --> 20:50.000
Kevin, to be honest, we had such a great time with our private pizza making party and pizza

20:50.000 --> 20:51.760
bite and everything.

20:51.760 --> 20:57.520
I cannot believe I'm going to say this, but I would actually be willing to give up

20:57.520 --> 20:58.800
sex to go out with you again.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.600
Kevin, you've actually made a woman not want to have sex ever again.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.760
Kevin's crazy.

21:09.760 --> 21:14.720
Now, I have to tell you your body was telling me something completely different.

21:14.720 --> 21:19.600
Oh, well, and I don't know if I'm being word.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.120
You truly restrained yourself.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.040
She's not going to take you to the room.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.200
Just, you know, have her way with you.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.440
Yeah, like you have a little bit of a saying it too.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.200
And Kevin, are you crazy?

21:31.200 --> 21:33.600
Like, how many women are offering this for you?

21:33.600 --> 21:37.120
I mean, I don't know many girls that would just stop having sex because they

21:37.200 --> 21:38.480
meet a guy who's that great.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.480
Thank you.

21:40.480 --> 21:43.600
Like, Brooke, she's got a husband and she still has sex with dudes all the time.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.560
You know, like she doesn't stop for him.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.960
Yeah, yeah.

21:48.960 --> 21:49.680
Good, Kevin.

21:51.440 --> 21:56.320
I know you say you're going to be able to wait, but just from what you'd said,

21:56.320 --> 21:58.400
a second ago, look at what you're giving up.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.000
So I just questioned that.

22:00.000 --> 22:00.960
That's all.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.480
I think you should have a little faith.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.080
Oh, good line.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.600
Stay as you just want to take it.

22:05.680 --> 22:06.560
Yeah.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.760
I'm not going to take it.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.720
You just want to take it.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.360
I'm not going to take it.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.560
I want that big card.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.360
All right.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.560
Well, that being said, would love to offer you guys the second date?

22:15.440 --> 22:16.320
We will pay for it.

22:17.920 --> 22:23.120
If I say, yeah, you think we'd be able to control ourselves.

22:24.800 --> 22:25.520
I do.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.080
I promise.

22:29.680 --> 22:30.960
All right, let's do it.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.240
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

22:32.240 --> 22:33.600
You're going to go out with Stacey again.

22:34.560 --> 22:35.520
Let's do it.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.560
Well, you're going to go out with her again.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.440
You're not going to do it.

22:37.440 --> 22:37.840
Yeah.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.240
But you will go out on another date.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.240
Wrong choice.

22:42.240 --> 22:42.640
Sorry.

22:44.640 --> 22:45.040
All right.

22:45.040 --> 22:45.680
It's Stacey.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.480
Well, congratulations.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.200
You got your date.
